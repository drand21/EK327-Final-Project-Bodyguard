This project is expanding on a computational modeling framework for modelling a member-joint truss system for withstanding load.
The project primarily uses Python to allow users to submit, study, and modify truss system designs.
A user is able to investigate how varying loads will affect the structural integrity of a truss and when it will buckle.
The program will also provide automatic calculations on maximum load, cost of of the design, and load to cost ratio.

The program can be built and run on any computer running Python 3. 
In order to run the program, the user will first need to install Python's matplotlib and scipy libraries.
Once these conditions are met, the user can run the program using the command line command: "Python3 main.py"
